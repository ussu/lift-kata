Python version of Lift Kata
============================

Note: the full description of this exercise is in the [top level README](https://github.com/emilybache/Lift-Kata).

Run the tests using pytest:

	python -m pytest

If you have a diff tool installed locally that you would like to use, I suggest installing [pytest-approvaltests](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-approvaltests/) and using it to configure pytest.
